Unfortunately, they need our help. Their son, Brendan Brock, had a tragic accident resulting in the loss of both of his legs. In addition to asking for more prayers, we are also asking for donations to help with medical expenses the insurance may not cover, home modifications that will need to be done before Brendan comes home, as well as assisting Lianne & Richie with travel/lodging from NJ to California during this critical time of healing for Brendan. So many people want to help this unbelievable family out so I created this Go Fund Me page. Your support is greatly appreciated. No donation is too small! ALL donations will be for the care & recovering efforts Brendan & his family are facing. Brendan has been gaining strength & asked me to post his video to show everyone his progress. #Brendanstrong

She was only 32 years old. As a young clinical psychologist, Jenn dedicated her life to helping servicemen and women reintegrate and readjust to civilian life. Every aspect of Jenn’s life was dedicated to others and her caring and kind spirit was evident to everyone she met. Jenn leaves behind her best friend, husband, and father of her unborn child, TJ. This memorial fund is set up by TJ and Jenn’s friends and all donations will go directly to TJ to help with memorial costs and adjusting to life without Jenn.

But it stunned and devastated his family with whom he shared so many adventures —his wife, Laurie Ochoa; their 23-year old daughter Isabel and 15-year old son Leon.  Jonathan loved being a food critic but he loved his family more, and though they are a valiant trio, his death has unmoored them in many ways, including financial.  Contributions will help them cover immediate expenses and provide for Izzy and Leon’s education.Photo courtesy of Anne Fishbein.

Nolan Sprague was in a diving accident and broke his neck. He is paralyzed from the chest down and his chances of ever walking again have been said to be low. Nolan and his family are the most generous and giving family and will do anything to help anyone. It is our time to help them out. He is currently in surgery and will need a lot of medical and financial help. If you are able to help donate it would be greatly appreciated. Words cannot describe what the family is going through right now. Nolan and his family will need many prayers, positive thoughts, and of course money going forward to get through this. Thank you so much!

Nia loved to do makeup, hair and get dolled up and enjoy life. Nia is a very caring and giving person who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Shouldn’t no mother or father have to put their 18 year old innocent child to rest because of a hateful inconsiderate person. We just want justice for Nia. Please pray for my family thank you. Nia will be loved and missed by so many family and friends. Please let’s end racism all over the world Nia did not deserve this.

Our goal is a fraction of what the building costs and we are trying to get as much help as we can. Regardless of how well this campaign does, we appreciate any help we receive and cant thank you guys enough for all the support you have given already. There is no guarantee we will get this exact building but we know what we are looking for and the extra help will make finding a new shop that much easier. We are trying to find something as soon as we can so Brent doesn't have to work from his backyard for too long.  Thank you guys so much!

Any amount you can give will be appreciated, and will help us to keep serving you and the community for years to come. With our deepest thanks, the Bookman

These dollars would have been used for our city’s bicentennial celebration. If you are a Memphian, Tennessean, or general supporter of the removal of these statues in our community, please, consider donating; 25,000 of us donating $10 each would replenish the dollars lost. All money raised will be given to the City of Memphis.

For those of you who may or may not know the Sorci family, on Monday March 12 David Sorci, father of Zack, Grace, Maggie and husband of Kelly, passed away unexpectedly. After undergoing many surgeries within 48 hours to try to save his life he passed away. With the devastating event we would like to raise as much money as possible for the amazing family. For those of you who know them the girls and the family are always there to help anyone who needs it and can always bring a smile to everyone’s face. Now it’s time to return the many favors this family has done for the people surrounding them. With the medical expenses building up and Grace and Maggie hoping to go to college within the next few years they could use as much help as possible. Any donation would be appreciated thank you.

He has fought on behalf of LGBTQ rights, to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic and to achieve healthcare access for all. I have borne witness to Andy’s tireless work on behalf of our community since 1991. During this time, he’s always put his personal concerns second and the concerns of his friends and community first. Anyone who knows Andy also knows this description to be a gross underrepresentation of his life-long accomplishments but there simply isn’t enough space here to document all that Andy has done for us.  Andy is now dealing with some health issues that not only increase his expenses but also make it harder to generate income to cover the cost of living. I hope that we can show him our appreciation with a gift of any amount.  Your support will permit Andy to continue his vital work.

About 20 years ago, he told me he would love to go to Alaska's national parks, and three times, I had saved enough to take him and his sister, Claudia, and my sister, Mary. All three times, an emergency arose that required me to liquidate the Alaska fund. Now, after a harrowing health year, we are trying once more to get the four of us to Alaska, while Bert's health has reached a good place. It's on his bucket list, and I am determined. With a little help from those who love Bert and want to help him celebrate his 85th, we hope to go in August of 2018! Thanks for considering, and sending Bert your good energy and love!
