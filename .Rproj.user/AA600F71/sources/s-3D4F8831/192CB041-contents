# GoFundMe

This is an ongoing project to see what types of GoFundMe projects are successful and also which GoFundMe projects are scams
or undeserving of fundraising.
GoFundMe does not provide an API for obtaining data from GoFundMe pages, therefore this project is a web scraper using 
selenium and chromedriver to navigate through the GoFundMe website to extract the top GoFundMe urls 
and then I use requests and BeautifulSoup to parse the raw html of each url in a systematic fashion. I can either directly
extract information from the urls using regex and BeautifulSoup, or I engineer features for the dataset, such as getting the
longitudes and latitudes from the city the user starts the GoFundMe from. 

The dataset can be downloaded easily by either downloading raw tab-delimited `GFM_data.csv` or by loading the `clean_GFM_data.RData` file by installing the R package (to include roxygen2 documentation) with the following command:

```{R}
devtools::install_github("lmeninato/GoFundMe")
```
To be added: documentation on the methodology of how the data was scraped.
